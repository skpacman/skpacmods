# Wild Bill Balatro Mod v0.5.7 by skpacman

This includes "Wild Bill" joker, a nod to Wild Bill Hickok of ye olde American West, who was shot over a hand of poker. The infamous "Dead Man's Hand" is added from this mod and, as the legendary story tells, the hand was just 4 cards; Two pair, Black Aces and Eights. And to round out this epic tale is the home of this historic tale, Deadwood SD emboldened in a brightly finished, yet rustic wooden Planet card dubbed "Deadwood". This mod also includes a special deck named "Mann's Gambit" after the saloon where this story takes place, Nuttal & Mann's Saloon.
